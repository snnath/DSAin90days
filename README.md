day 1&2:learn about space and time complexity.

    Time complexity: best case(omega(1)), average case(theta(n)) and worst case(O(n)).
    Always worst case scenario is taken into consideration for coding.
    
    Space complexity: How much space is being consumed in the memory when an operation
    is being ran. How many vaariables are stored the memory. 
    
day3-10: recursion and backtracking.
day 11-30- arrays, linked lists, stacks & queues.
