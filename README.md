# DSAin90days

day 1&2:learn about space and time complexity.

    Time complexity: best case(omega(1)), average case(theta(n)) and worst case(O(n)).
    Always worst case scenario is taken into consideration for coding.
    
    Space complexity: How much space is being consumed in the memory when an operation
    is being ran. How many vaariables are stored the memory. 
    
day3-10: recursion and backtracking.
    
    day2
    Recursion: call stack analogy, string reversal, decimal to binary, sum of natural numbers.
    Divide and conquer: Binary search, fibonacci, merge sort.
    Linked lists reversal. 1:15
    
    day3
    Merging two sorted linked lists. 
    Trees:inserting a value into a binary search tree. Print all leaf nodes. 1:40 (not much progress, got distracted and started solving fcc and codechef.)

day 11-30- arrays, linked lists, stacks & queues.
